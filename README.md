# HTML-CSS-Challenge
This was an HTML and CSS Challenge taken for a recruitment process, the task being to replicate a website in HTML and CSS given an image of the site.

My take on the replicated page

# Clarifications
The aesthetics of the page were guessed at during replication, with some uncertainties (mostly with regards to spacing). I identified the proper hex codes for the background colors of the logo and copyright sections, but used common colors such as black, grey, and green in most places. The blue arrows in the picture were not included, as an image was not provided for them, and I am not aware of an HTML element for adding arrows (without using my own image, or text characters that do not resemble them). Therefore, I assumed that the arrows were meant to indicate that there should be margins betweeen the page content and the ends of the screen. 

I also used my personal favorite Lorem ipsum substitute, Bacon ipsum, as the long form Lorem ipsum text could not be readily found. 

# Improvements
To make the page more responsive, I would first look into accomodating a wider selection of device formats and screen sizes. I replicated the given website with the web format and personal computer/laptop device in mind, and tried to increase responsiveness to window resizing using vw and vh properties. However, the page would be the most responsive if designed with common screen sizes in mind, based off aspect ratios. The most obvious example of this would be for smartphone devices, such as the 9:19.5 aspect ratio used by the popular iPhone (but even an approximate smartphone aspect ratio could be used). Other devices might include tablets, smart watches, ultrawide monitors, and foldable phones. Examples of actual changes to the page might include switching the flex direction of the text columns from row to column for narrower devices. 

To improve overall user experience, additional pages and navigation could be implemented to split up the information into more concise pages (i.e. separating the Portfolio, About, Projects, and Table sections into separate webpages). Moreover, accessibility features can be implemented to make the page easier to interpret, including adding alt text to images (which has been done), using whitespace more efficiently, and using bigger fonts.
